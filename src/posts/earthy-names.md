## Choosing an Earthy Name

The best nature names share a quality: they feel like they've always existed as names, even when they haven't. They don't need explanation. Say them out loud — the ones that feel natural rolling off your tongue are the ones worth keeping on your list.

Consider how the name pairs with your last name, how it shortens for nicknames, and whether it carries a meaning that resonates with you. The right name feels like finding something that was already there, waiting.
