Your body runs on a roughly 24.2-hour internal clock — slightly longer than an actual day. That tiny detail explains why flying east destroys you more than flying west.

## Your Clock Naturally Drifts Later

Because your circadian rhythm runs slightly *longer* than 24 hours, your body finds it easier to stay up late than to fall asleep early. Flying west extends your day, which aligns with your body's natural drift. Flying east shortens it, forcing you to sleep before your body is ready.

Think of it this way: staying awake an extra three hours feels manageable. Going to bed three hours early feels impossible.

## The Research Backs It Up

A 2016 study published in the journal *Chaos* built a mathematical model of the circadian system and found that recovery from eastward travel takes significantly longer. For a 9-hour eastward shift, the model predicted roughly 8 days of recovery. The same shift westward? About 4 days.

The asymmetry gets worse as the time difference grows. For short trips (2-3 timezone jumps), you might not notice much difference. Cross 6 or more zones heading east, and you'll feel it.

## What Actually Happens in Your Brain

Your suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) — a tiny cluster of cells in your hypothalamus — acts as your master clock. It takes cues primarily from light to synchronize your sleep-wake cycle with the local environment.

When you fly east, the SCN needs to advance your entire schedule: sleep earlier, wake earlier, release melatonin earlier. This "phase advance" fights your body's natural tendency to drift later.

When you fly west, the SCN needs to delay everything — which it's already inclined to do. The adjustment is faster because you're working *with* your biology, not against it.

## Light Exposure Is the Fix

The single most effective tool for resetting your clock after eastward travel is strategic light exposure:

- **Morning sunlight** on arrival helps advance your clock. Get outside for at least 30 minutes as early as possible.
- **Avoid evening light** for the first 2-3 days. Bright screens and overhead lights in the evening will push your clock in the wrong direction.
- **Combine with timed melatonin** — a low dose (0.5-1mg) taken 30 minutes before your target bedtime in the new timezone can accelerate the phase advance.

## The Practical Takeaway

If you're flying east across 5+ timezones, start shifting your schedule 2-3 days before departure. Move your bedtime earlier by 30 minutes per day. Seek morning light and avoid evening screens.

Flying west? You can mostly wing it. Your body will catch up within a couple of days with minimal effort.

The direction of travel matters more than the distance. Plan accordingly, and eastbound trips don't have to wreck your first few days at the destination.
