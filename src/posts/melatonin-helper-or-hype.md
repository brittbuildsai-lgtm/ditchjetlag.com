Walk into any pharmacy before an international trip and you'll find an entire shelf of melatonin products promising to cure jet lag. But does melatonin actually work — and if so, how should you use it?

## What Melatonin Actually Is

Melatonin isn't a sleeping pill. It's a hormone your brain already produces naturally, secreted by the pineal gland when it gets dark outside. Its job isn't to knock you out — it's to signal to your body that nighttime has arrived and it's time to wind down.

This distinction matters. Melatonin doesn't force sleep the way sedatives do. Instead, it shifts the *timing* of your internal clock. That's exactly why it's relevant for jet lag — jet lag is fundamentally a timing problem.

## The Evidence: It Works (With Caveats)

A Cochrane review — the gold standard of medical evidence — analyzed 10 randomized trials and found that melatonin taken close to the target bedtime at the destination significantly reduced jet lag severity. The effect was most pronounced for eastward travel crossing 5 or more time zones.

However, the research also revealed some important nuances:

- **Timing is everything.** Melatonin taken at the wrong time can actually shift your clock in the wrong direction, making jet lag worse. Taking it in the morning when you should be waking up is counterproductive.
- **Less is more.** Doses between 0.5mg and 3mg were effective. Higher doses (5-10mg) didn't improve results and were more likely to cause grogginess and vivid dreams.
- **It's not a standalone fix.** Melatonin worked best when combined with light management and schedule shifting. On its own, it helps — but it's one tool, not a complete solution.

## How to Use It for Jet Lag

**For eastward travel** (the harder direction):

Take 0.5-1mg of melatonin 30 minutes before your target bedtime in the new timezone, starting the night you arrive. Continue for 3-4 nights. This helps advance your clock — telling your body "it's nighttime now" even though your internal clock disagrees.

**For westward travel:**

Melatonin is less critical heading west since your body naturally adjusts more easily. If you're crossing 6+ zones, a small dose (0.5mg) in the early morning hours of the new timezone can help if you're waking too early.

## The Dosage Mistake Most People Make

The most common melatonin products sold in pharmacies are 5mg or 10mg tablets. These are almost certainly too much for jet lag purposes.

Research consistently shows that 0.5-1mg is the effective range for circadian shifting. Higher doses flood your receptors, cause morning drowsiness, and can paradoxically reduce effectiveness because your body starts clearing the excess hormone faster.

Look for low-dose options or buy 3mg tablets and cut them in half. Time-release formulations aren't necessary for jet lag — you want a quick signal, not a sustained dose.

## What About Other Supplements?

**Magnesium glycinate (200-400mg):** Modest evidence for improving sleep quality. Relatively safe, may help with the muscle tension from long flights.

**Valerian root:** Mixed evidence. Some people swear by it, studies are inconsistent.

**Diphenhydramine (Benadryl, ZzzQuil):** Avoid for jet lag. It induces sleep but suppresses REM, which is exactly the type of sleep your brain needs to recalibrate its clock.

**CBD:** Very limited evidence for circadian shifting specifically. May help with general relaxation but isn't a jet lag tool.

## The Bottom Line

Melatonin is a legitimate, research-backed tool for jet lag — but only when used correctly. Low dose, right timing, combined with light exposure strategy. It's a helper, not hype, but it's also not magic. The best jet lag protocol uses melatonin as one piece of a larger plan that includes light management, meal timing, and schedule pre-shifting.

Talk to your doctor before starting any supplement, especially if you take other medications or have autoimmune conditions.
