# Best Foods to Beat Jet Lag (And What to Avoid at 35,000 Feet)

Your gut has its own circadian clock — and what you eat (and when) can either accelerate your recovery or make jet lag drag on for days. Here's how to eat your way to a faster adjustment.

## Your Gut Clock Is Real

Scientists call it the "food-entrainable oscillator." It's a secondary clock in your digestive system that responds to meal timing independently of light. When you eat on your destination's schedule, you're giving your body a powerful second signal to shift.

This is why fasting on the plane and breaking your fast at destination breakfast time is one of the most effective jet lag strategies that most travelers overlook.

## Foods That Help

**Protein-rich breakfasts** — Eggs, yogurt, nuts, or lean meat in the morning at your destination help promote alertness. Protein triggers tyrosine production, a precursor to dopamine and norepinephrine, which keep you awake and focused.

**Complex carbs at dinner** — Whole grains, sweet potatoes, and rice at your destination's dinner time promote serotonin and melatonin production, helping you wind down and fall asleep on local time.

**Tart cherries** — One of the few natural food sources of melatonin. Tart cherry juice before your destination bedtime can support your body's sleep signals.

**Bananas** — Rich in magnesium and potassium, which help muscles relax. They also contain tryptophan, a building block of melatonin.

**Ginger and peppermint** — Both settle the stomach, which is useful since jet lag often causes digestive discomfort. Ginger tea on the plane is a solid move.

## What to Avoid in the Air

**Alcohol** — It dehydrates you, disrupts sleep architecture, and makes jet lag significantly worse. That free wine in business class isn't worth it.

**Salty, heavy meals** — Airline food is often loaded with sodium, which increases dehydration and bloating. Eat lighter than you normally would.

**Sugary snacks** — The blood sugar spike and crash will mess with your energy levels and make it harder to stay awake or sleep at the right times.

**Large meals right before trying to sleep** — Your digestive system will keep you up. If you're trying to sleep on the plane, eat a light meal an hour or two before.

## The Strategic Fasting Approach

Many frequent flyers and circadian researchers recommend a 12-16 hour fast aligned with your destination:

1. **Stop eating** about 12-16 hours before breakfast time at your destination
2. **Stay hydrated** — water and herbal tea are fine during the fast
3. **Break your fast** with a protein-rich meal at destination breakfast time

This effectively tells your gut clock: "This is morning now." Combined with light exposure, it's a powerful one-two punch.

## A Simple In-Flight Eating Plan

- **Before departure**: Eat a balanced meal on your current schedule
- **During flight**: Eat lightly or fast, focus on hydration (8oz water per hour)
- **On arrival**: Eat on local time immediately, even if you're not hungry
- **First breakfast**: High protein (eggs, nuts, yogurt)
- **First dinner**: Complex carbs (rice, potatoes, whole grains)

## The Bottom Line

You don't need special supplements or expensive products. Strategic meal timing — when you eat matters more than what you eat — combined with the right food choices can meaningfully speed up your circadian adjustment. Your gut is listening. Feed it on the right schedule.
