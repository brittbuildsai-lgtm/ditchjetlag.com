You just landed after a long flight, and your body thinks it's 3am. Here's how to compress what normally takes 3-5 days of recovery into a single aggressive reset day. This isn't gentle — but it works.

## The First Hour: Set the Anchor

The moment you arrive, commit fully to local time. Don't calculate what time it is "back home." That mental math keeps your brain in the old timezone.

- **Set every device** to local time (your phone probably did this already)
- **Eat something** on the local meal schedule, even if you're not hungry. A small meal with protein and complex carbs signals to your gut clock that it's time to recalibrate
- **Sunlight immediately** if it's daytime. Get outside, face the sky (not directly at the sun), and walk for at least 15 minutes

## Morning Arrival Protocol

If you land in the morning (the easier scenario):

**Do not nap.** This is the hardest part and the most important. A 20-minute "power nap" inevitably becomes 3 hours and wrecks your first night.

Instead:
- **Walk outside** for 30+ minutes. Morning sunlight is the strongest circadian reset signal available
- **Drink coffee** strategically — one cup between 8-10am local time, one more at lunch if needed. Hard stop at 1pm
- **Stay active** until at least 9pm local time. Schedule something social or physical for the afternoon — the engagement keeps you awake
- **Eat three meals** on the local schedule. Your gut has its own circadian clock, and meal timing is one of the most powerful secondary reset cues
- **Go to bed at 10pm local time** — not earlier, even if you're fading. Use blackout curtains and keep the room cool (65-68 degrees)

## Afternoon/Evening Arrival Protocol

If you land in the afternoon or evening (harder):

- **Get outside immediately** for whatever daylight remains
- **Eat dinner on schedule** even if it feels like breakfast to your body
- **Take a warm shower** 90 minutes before target bedtime — the subsequent body temperature drop promotes sleepiness
- **Low-dose melatonin** (0.5-1mg) 30 minutes before bed if you have it. Timing matters more than dose
- **Full blackout** — eye mask, dark room, no screens for at least 30 minutes before bed
- **If you can't sleep after 20 minutes,** get up and do something boring in dim light (read a physical book, stretch). Don't check your phone. Return to bed when drowsy

## The Supplement Stack

If you want pharmaceutical support (consult your doctor):

- **Melatonin 0.5-1mg** — 30 minutes before target bedtime. Less is more with melatonin. Higher doses can cause grogginess
- **Magnesium glycinate 200-400mg** — promotes muscle relaxation and sleep quality
- **Skip sleep aids like diphenhydramine** — they knock you out but suppress REM sleep, which is exactly what your brain needs to recalibrate

## Day 2: The Confirmation

If you executed Day 1 correctly, Day 2 should feel dramatically better:

- Wake at local time (set an alarm, don't oversleep)
- Morning sunlight again for 20+ minutes
- Resume normal caffeine habits
- You should feel 70-80% adjusted

The remaining 20-30% resolves naturally over the next day or two without any special effort.

## The Non-Negotiables

If you remember nothing else:

1. **No naps on arrival day** — this is the single biggest predictor of fast recovery
2. **Morning sunlight** — 30 minutes minimum, the sooner the better
3. **Eat on local time** — three meals, roughly normal hours
4. **Bedtime discipline** — pick a time, stick to it, full blackout

Jet lag is a clock problem. Give your body the right signals at the right time, and it resets remarkably fast. One disciplined day is all it takes.
